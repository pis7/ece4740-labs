Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.

    WARNING: The cm value is specified for the tran analysis fastcross option but this value is supported only by AMS-Ultra or AMS-Spectre integrated with new Front-End. The simulator uses the fastcross discrete value instead of the cm value.

Notice from spectre during transient analysis `tran'.
    Trapezoidal ringing is detected during tran analysis.
        Please use method=trap for better results and performance.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(I0.12\:net1) = 1.428 V
I: I(V2:p) = 338.9 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.
